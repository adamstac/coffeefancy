# Coffeefancy

*Community-driven Coffee repo. Stars, stars, stars!*

This is a community-driven coffee brewing repository, and was inspired by [tacofancy](https://github.com/sinker/tacofancy).

Please fork and submit your own brewing methods, beans, roasters, and resources. Our aim is to create one of the most organized, and comprehensive resources for brewing coffee.

This project is a work-in-progress (but I'd love some help). Check the [issues](/issues) for open assignments or todos.

- [Brew Methods](brew-methods/)
- [Beans](beans/)
- [Equipment](equipment/)

## Why?

I was tired of having my own personal resources kinda of all over the place. If someone asked me about a brew method, I wasn't able to point them any where in particular. If they wanted to learn about the beans or roasters I've used or trust, I couldn't share a link with them. No more.

This repository is aimed to be  a community-driven effort. Fork it and pitch in.
