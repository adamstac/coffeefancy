# Chemex

- Grind coffee beans at medium coarseness setting
- Start with a ~16:1 water:coffee ratio and tune to taste (1 cup is ~250-300g water)

1. Wet the filter before adding coffee to remove paper taste
2. Wet ground coffee and allow to 'bloom' for 1 minute
3. Pour water slowly in a circular, nickel size pattern
